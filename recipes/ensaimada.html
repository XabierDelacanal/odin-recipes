        <p>These are delicious Spanish breakfast rolls </p>
        <p>made from yeast dough that is rolled into spiral circles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tablespoons lukewarm milk</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the yeast and milk. In a large bowl, stir together the bread flour, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center, and pour in the yeast mixture. Cover with a light dusting of flour, and let stand for about 15 minutes, until frothy.</li>
            <li>Stir together the egg and oil, and pour into the bowl with the flour. Mix until the dough comes together then turn out onto a floured surface, and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, and cover. Let stand for about 20 minutes to relax.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Divide the dough into 15 pieces. Roll each piece into a 12 inch long rope. Roll the ropes into a spiral shape, and place on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
